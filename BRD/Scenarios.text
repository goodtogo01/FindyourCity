To automate your website, I’ll break it down into several scenarios, and based on those scenarios, I will provide test cases and steps, separating them into Unit, Integration, and Regression test suites.

1. Possible Scenarios:
	1.	Login Scenarios:
	•	Successful login with valid credentials.
	•	Invalid login with incorrect username/password.
	•	Empty login fields (username/password empty).
	•	Login with valid credentials but unsuccessful due to session expiration.
	•	Login with a valid user but unsuccessful due to network issues.
	2.	Country, State, and City Selection:
        •	Select a country and state, and then select a city.
        •	Select a country but leave the state or city unselected.
        •	Select a state but leave the country or city unselected.
        •	Select a city but leave the country or state unselected.
	3.	UI Element Interactions:
        •	Check visibility of country/state/city dropdowns.
        •	Check the visibility of labels for country/state/city (hide labels on selection).
        •	Ensure the “New Search” button works as expected after selection.
	4.	Logout Scenarios:
	•	Successfully logout and check redirection to the login page.
	•	Logout and try accessing the main page without logging in again (should redirect to the login page).
	5.	City Details Display:
	•	Verify the city details are displayed once a city is selected.
	•	Ensure the data is correct and corresponding to the selected city.

2. Test Cases and Steps:

Login Scenarios:
	1.	Successful Login with Valid Credentials
	•	Test Case: Verify that users can login with valid credentials.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the login page.
	2.	Enter a valid username.
	3.	Enter the valid password.
	4.	Click the login button.
	5.	Assert that the user is redirected to the homepage (index.html).
	6.	Verify that the “Logout” button is visible.
	2.	Invalid Login with Incorrect Credentials
	•	Test Case: Verify that login fails with incorrect credentials.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the login page.
	2.	Enter an invalid username.
	3.	Enter an incorrect password.
	4.	Click the login button.
	5.	Assert that an error message is shown (e.g., “Invalid credentials”).
	6.	Ensure the user remains on the login page.
	3.	Empty Login Fields
	•	Test Case: Verify that the user cannot login with empty username or password.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the login page.
	2.	Leave the username and password fields empty.
	3.	Click the login button.
	4.	Assert that the appropriate error message is shown (e.g., “Fields cannot be empty”).
	4.	Login with Valid Credentials but Session Expired
	•	Test Case: Verify that the user is redirected to the login page if the session has expired.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the login page.
	2.	Login with valid credentials.
	3.	Wait until the session expires (simulate session expiration).
	4.	Attempt to access index.html.
	5.	Assert that the user is redirected to the login page.

Country, State, and City Selection:
	1.	Select Country, State, and City
	•	Test Case: Verify that the user can select a country, state, and city correctly.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the homepage.
	2.	Select a valid country from the country dropdown.
	3.	Select a state from the state dropdown.
	4.	Select a city from the city dropdown.
	5.	Assert that the city information is displayed.
	2.	Select Country but No State or City
	•	Test Case: Verify that no city details are displayed when only the country is selected.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the homepage.
	2.	Select a valid country from the dropdown.
	3.	Leave the state and city fields empty.
	4.	Assert that no city information is displayed.

UI Element Interactions:
	1.	Visibility of Country, State, and City Dropdowns
        Test Case: Verify that the dropdowns for country, state, and city are visible after selecting previous options.
        Steps:
            1.	Open the homepage.
            2.	Select a country.
            3.	Assert that the state dropdown is visible.
            4.	Select a state.
            5.	Assert that the city dropdown is visible.
	2.	Hide Labels for Dropdowns after Selection
        Test Case: Verify that the labels for country, state, and city are hidden once the user selects an option.
        Steps:
            1.	Open the homepage.
            2.	Select a country.
            3.	Assert that the country label is hidden.
            4.	Select a state.
            5.	Assert that the state label is hidden.
            6.	Select a city.
            7.	Assert that the city label is hidden.

Logout Scenarios:
	1.	Successful Logout
	•	Test Case: Verify that the user can successfully log out.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Open the homepage after login.
	2.	Click the logout button.
	3.	Assert that the user is redirected to the login page.
	4.	Verify that the “Login” page elements are visible.

	•	Test Case: Verify that the main page is inaccessible after logout without login.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Log out from the homepage.
	2.	Attempt to access the main page directly.
	3.	Assert that the user is redirected to the login page.

3. Test Suite Separation:

Unit Test Suite:
	•	Test individual components or methods in isolation (e.g., helper methods, UI components).
	•	Example:
	•	Test login form validation (e.g., valid username and password fields).

Integration Test Suite:
	•	Test the interactions between multiple components (e.g., login form, city dropdown, session handling).
	•	Example:
	•	Test successful login and subsequent access to the city selection feature.

Regression Test Suite:
	•	Ensure that existing features work after new changes.
	•	Example:
	•	Re-run the entire test suite after any changes to ensure no functionality is broken.

Automation Implementation Steps:
	1.	Setting up Maven & Dependencies:
	•	Add TestNG, Selenium, ExtentReports, and any other necessary dependencies in pom.xml.
	2.	Create Base Test Class:
	•	Include setup, teardown, and reporting methods using ExtentReports.
	3.	Create Test Cases in TestNG:
	•	Define test methods for each of the scenarios outlined above.
	4.	Use Assertions and Reports:
	•	Use assertions to validate test outcomes and generate ExtentReports for detailed logs.

I can help you with the code for these test cases, the test suite structure, and the setup if needed. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with the implementation!
